		<h2>Koka a function oriented language with effect inference</h2>
		<blockquote><p>Koka is a function-oriented programming language that seperates pure values from side-effecting computations, where the effect of every function is automatically inferred. Koka has many features that help programmers to easily change their data types and code organization correctly, while having a small language core with a familiar JavaScript like syntax.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/koka/">Koka</a> extends the idea of using row polymorphism to encode an effect system and the relations between them. <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/people/daan/">Daan Leijen</a> is the primary researcher behind it and his research was featured previously on LtU, mainly on <a href="http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/node/174">row polymorphism</a> in the <a href="http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/node/1119">Morrow Language</a>.</p>
<p>So far there's no paper available on the language design, just the <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/koka/2012-overviewkoka.pdf">slides</a> from a Lang.Next talk (which doesn't seem to have video available at <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Lang-NEXT/Lang-NEXT-2012">Channel 9</a>), but it's in the program for <a href="http://hope2012.mpi-sws.org/">HOPE 2012</a>.</p>
