		<h2>Peyton-Jones and Harris discuss STM (1h video)</h2>

<em><a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/Showpost.aspx?postid=231495">Programming in the Age of Concurrency: Software Transactional Memory</a></em></p>
<p>ï»¿Recently, we visited MSR Cambridge(UK) to meet some of the great minds working there. In this case, we were fortunate enough to get an hour's time with Simon Peyton-Jones and Tim Harris, who are researchers working on a very hard problem: making it easier (more predictable, more reliable, more composable) to write concurrent applications in this the age of Concurrency (multi-core is a reality, not a dream).
