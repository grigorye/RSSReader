		<h2>A Concept Design for C++</h2>
		<p>In the video <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/GoingNative/GoingNative-2012/A-Concept-Design-for-C-">A Concept Design for C++</a> and the related paper <a href="http://www2.research.att.com/~bs/sle2011-concepts.pdf">Design of Concept Libraries for C++</a> Bjarne Stroustrup and Andrew Sutton describe how they're going avoid the problems that lead to concepts getting <a href="http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/node/3518">voted out of C++11</a>.  In a nutshell they seem to be focusing on the simplest thing that could possibly work for STL (C++'s Standard Template Library).</p>
<blockquote><p>
C++ does not provide facilities for directly expressing what a function template requires of its set of parameters. This is a problem that manifests itself as poor error messages, obscure bugs, lack of proper overloading, poor specification of interfaces, and maintenance problems.</p>
<p>Many have tried to remedy this (in many languages) by adding sets of requirements, commonly known as "concepts." Many of these efforts, notably the C++0x concept design, have run into trouble by focusing on the design of language features.</p>
<p>This talk presents the results of an effort to first focus on the design of concepts and their use; Only secondarily, we look at the design of language features to support the resulting concepts. We describe the problem, our approach to a solution, give examples of concepts for the STL algorithms and containers, and finally show an initial design of language features. We also show how we use a library implementation to test our design.</p>
<p>So far, this effort has involved more than a dozen people, including the father of the STL, Alex Stepanov, but we still consider it research in progress rather than a final design. This design has far fewer concepts than the C++0x design and far simpler language support. The design is mathematically well founded and contains extensive semantic specifications (axioms).
