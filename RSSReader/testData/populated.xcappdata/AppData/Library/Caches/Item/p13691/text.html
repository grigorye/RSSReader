		<h2>Apple’s Message to Customers About iPhone Batteries and Performance</h2>
		<p><a href="https://www.apple.com/iphone-battery-and-performance/">Apple</a> (<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16025112">Hacker News</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2017/12/28/apple-iphone-battery-performance-price-drop/">MacRumors</a>, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2017/12/apple-to-lower-battery-replacement-costs-for-select-iphones-to-29/">ArsTechnica</a>):</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>We’ve been hearing feedback from our customers about the way we handle performance for iPhones with older batteries and how we have communicated that process. We know that some of you feel Apple has let you down. We apologize.</p> 
<p>[…]</p> 
<p>Apple is reducing the price of an out-of-warranty iPhone battery replacement by $50 — from $79 to $29 — for anyone with an iPhone 6 or later whose battery needs to be replaced, starting in late January and available worldwide through December 2018.</p> 
<p>Early in 2018, we will issue an iOS software update with new features that give users more visibility into the health of their iPhone’s battery, so they can see for themselves if its condition is affecting performance.</p>

<p><a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208387">Apple</a>:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>In addition, a battery’s ability to provide power quickly may decrease. In order for a phone to function properly, the electronics must be able to draw upon instantaneous power from the battery. One attribute that affects this instantaneous power delivery is the battery’s impedance. A battery with a high impedance is unable to provide power quickly enough to the system that needs it. A battery's impedance can increase if a battery has a higher chemical age. A battery’s impedance will temporarily increase at a low state of charge and in a cold temperature environment. When coupled with a higher chemical age, the impedance increase will be more significant. These are characteristics of battery chemistry which are common to all lithium-ion batteries in the industry.</p> 
<p>[…]</p> 
<p>This power management works by looking at a combination of the device temperature, battery state of charge, and the battery’s impedance. Only if these variables require it, iOS will dynamically manage the maximum performance of some system components, such as the CPU and GPU in order to prevent unexpected shutdowns.</p> 
</blockquote> 
 
<p>I think this is a pretty good response. An excellent response would have acknowledged the elephant in the room, which is that although Apple didn’t “do anything to intentionally shorten the life” of the phones, all the <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/how-apple-could-have-prevented-the-iphone-slowdown-controversy-2017-12-23">design</a> <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=15994176">parameters</a> were of Apple’s choosing. iPhone’s desktop-class processors seem to draw power in a more problematic way than processors in competing phones, and Apple could have mitigated the problem by using larger batteries. They didn’t “shorten the life,” but neither did they communicate it to the customer, and they could have designed the phone to have a longer life.</p> 
 
<p>If I were Apple, I’d just make the $29 battery replacement fee permanent, or at least for a certain number of years after the phone was purchased. That would generate a lot of good will.</p> 
 
<p>Some remaining questions:</p> 
 
<ul><li><p>Will the $29 fee apply to any customer who wants a new battery? Or does the battery need to fail the diagnostics at the retail store? It think it should be available for any under-performing phone.</p></li> 
 
<li><p>Will the iOS update show information about the health of the battery? Or are they just adding a binary indicator that shows when throttling is happening?</p></li> 
 
<li><p>What <em>is</em> the design life of an iPhone? Apple doesn’t say. Since they’re not doing another recall (or offering free battery replacements after year one), presumably it’s considered normal for an iPhone to need throttling after less than two years. This again makes it more of a design issue than a chemistry issue.</p></li> 
 
<li><p>How many iPhones are affected? It’s interesting that this time Apple did not repeat the “small number of users” language that accompanied the iOS 10.2.1 update.</p></li> 
 
<li><p>There’s still somewhat of a <a href="https://twitter.com/markgurman/status/946512371031293953">mystery</a> about whether the throttling only comes into play to prevent <a href="https://twitter.com/nicklockwood/status/946514338919206912">imminent shutdown</a>.</p></li> 
 
<li><p>What about all the people who bought new iPhones but would have been happy with new batteries, if they’d known? I suppose there’s not much Apple can practically do to make that right.</p></li> 
 
<li><p>What about the <a href="https://twitter.com/stroughtonsmith/status/946504360028229634">iPhone 5s</a>?</p></li> 
 
<li><p>Why is there <a href="https://twitter.com/markgurman/status/946506614848217088">disagreement</a> in the press about whether there’s any actual <a href="https://twitter.com/reneritchie/status/946501696519249920">news</a> here?</p></li> 
 
<li><p>Why are some <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4134069-apple-slandered-chemistry-fix">pundits</a> so <a href="https://twitter.com/asymco/status/946504252263993344">obtuse</a>?</p></li> 
 
<li><p>Are <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=15998958">Macs throttled</a> as well? Our 2010 MacBook Pro, whose battery is in decent condition, got (and remained) <em>much</em> slower after installing High Sierra.</p></li>

<p>Making the price of a battery replacement $29 will destroy the sketchy third party battery market which has a lot of other benefits for both Apple and customers. Quality replacements that don’t break your phone.</p>

<blockquote> 
<p>This will also be useful for used iPhone buyers - a screengrab of the battery health report should become standard in listings (or a “not worse than” commitment for higher-volume resellers)</p>

<blockquote> 
<p>I don’t think Apple’s entirely disingenuous when it says it designs its products to last.</p> 
<p>But I do think that Apple has never made any great effort to promote battery replacement over buying a new phone, or ensure iOS performance is acceptable on older models.</p>

<p>I totally believe that they’re being sincere. I also think they want people to buy a new phone every two years. :)</p>

<p>The funny thing about Apple is that their communication problems tend to happen only when they don’t communicate at all.</p>

<blockquote> 
<p>I replaced my iPhone 6 battery back in August because it was failing around the 30% mark, and the performance increase was very noticeable indeed–right until iOS 11 came along, that is.</p> 
<p>Even if 11.2 is now almost fast enough on this hardware, if I hadn’t replaced the battery the phone would likely be completely unusable by now.</p>
