		<h2>Improving URLs for AMP Pages</h2>
		<p><a href="https://amphtml.wordpress.com/2018/01/09/improving-urls-for-amp-pages/amp/">Malte Ubl</a> (<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16111985">Hacker News</a>):</p> 
<blockquote><p>We are making changes to how AMP works in platforms such as Google Search that will enable linked pages to appear under publishers’ URLs instead of the google.com/amp URL space while maintaining the performance and privacy benefits of AMP Cache serving.</p> 
<p>[…]</p> 
<p>Based on this web standard AMP navigations from Google Search can take advantage of privacy-preserving preloading and the performance of Google’s servers, while URLs remain as the publisher intended and the primary security context of the web, the origin, remains intact. We have built a prototype based on the Chrome Browser and an experimental version of Google Search to make sure it actually does deliver on both the desired UX and performance in real use cases.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote> 
<p>This announcement isn’t bad news, and might be good news, but at this point it’s all conjecture, particularly for browsers other than Chrome. Even if it all works out, it only solves one problem: URLs. It doesn’t solve the deeper problem of content being hosted on Google’s servers, rather than publishers’ own servers. In addition to ceding independence, think about what this means for search engines other than Google. One of AMP’s foundational tenets is that Google Search is the one and only search engine.</p>
