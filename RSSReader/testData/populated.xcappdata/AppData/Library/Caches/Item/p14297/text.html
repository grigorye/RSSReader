		<h2>Finally...</h2>
		<p>I finally got around to setting up a new blog at <a href="http://calayer.com">calayer.com</a>!</p> 
 
 
 
<p>So, what will this blog be about? As you may have inferred from its name, this blog is primarily focused on technical topics in Core Animation for iOS and tvOS. However, I’m also interested in other graphics frameworks for iOS as well, such as Core Image and SceneKit, so expect to see some posts involving those from time to time. I may also write about design, visual effects, and motion graphics in general.</p> 
 
<p>I’ll probably have to spend a good bit of time figuring out how to add certain features to this blog that I want, like nice syntax highlighting, searchability, tag and category pages, and comments. (I’m an iOS native dev guy, so all this web stuff is completely foreign to me; Jekyll, SASS, CSS, JavaScript and all that other fancy, modern tech currently makes no sense.) In the meantime, please excuse me if this site is pretty basic. As long as I can write up articles with appropriate, clear formatting for displaying code and media—like GIFs and videos—, it should suffice.</p>
