		<h2>Hasura</h2>
		Managed infrastructure and built in APIs that give you access to complex backend functionality without writing any code. Hasura uses the power of Postgres to give you instant data APIs that let you query the database in JSON without any backend code, or you can extend the built in functionality with your own custom micro-services. You also get out of the box auth APIs for a number of common authentication providers including Facebook, Google, and email. Finally, you get filestore APIs to handle user based file upload, download and deletion. <br><br>View on <a href="https://iosdev.tools/tool?utm_source=feed&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=rss%20feed&amp;id=hasura">iOS Dev Tools</a>.
