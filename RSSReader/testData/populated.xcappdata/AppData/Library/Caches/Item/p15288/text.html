		<h2>Sharing Links From iOS Twitter Appends Tracking Garbage to the URL</h2>
		<p><a href="http://benjaminmayo.co.uk/twitter-app-sharing-link-garbage">Benjamin Mayo</a>:</p> 
<blockquote><p>There’s been <a href="https://twitter.com/viticci/status/950886902152007680">a change</a> to the official Twitter app in the last few months that affects anyone who tries to share a <span>URL</span> from inside the app. Using the standard activity view controller, recognised as the system share sheet, the Twitter app surreptitiously appends some query string parameters to the original <span>URL</span>.</p><p>[…]</p><p>If the user commits to sharing the URL without amending the link, Twitter can see that its iOS app was the origin of the engagement if that URL is posted publicly.</p><p>[…]</p><p>If you share to Bear, the string will literally contain the words ‘Bear-iPhone-Sharing-Extension’. One of the more obtuse ones I’ve seen is <code>com.tinyspeck.chatlyio.share</code> … but a quick Google search reveals that it represents the Slack sharing extension.</p><p>The fact that thee last component changes dynamically based on what action the user selects feels invasive if you don’t know what’s going on at the API level. Users are told that the activity share sheet is managed by Apple so instinctively it feels like being able to grab the activity type is nefarious.</p></blockquote>
