		<h2>LifetimeTracker</h2>
		A debugging tool to help you identify retain cycles and memory issues while running your app. LifetimeTracker requires just one line of code to integrate into your app, and it'll give you a floating bar that lets you know when it identifies an issue. Tapping the info button gives you full details of the issue including the leaked object type and address. Unlike other retain cycle detectors that rely on Objective-C runtime magic, this small tool simply focuses on tracking lifetime of objects which means that it can be used in both Objective-C and Swift codebases. <br><br>View on <a href="https://iosdev.tools/tool?utm_source=feed&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=rss%20feed&amp;id=lifetimetracker">iOS Dev Tools</a>.
