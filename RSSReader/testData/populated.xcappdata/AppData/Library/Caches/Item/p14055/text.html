<p>Looking back, 2017 was a great year for Swift. With Swift 4, we got key paths, <code>Codable</code>, multiline string literals, and much more. The community has been awesome too: we saw a number of promising new libraries, a rich variety of conference talks, and perhaps best of all, new voices joining the Swift community from all kinds of backgrounds.</p>  
  
<p>It was also a productive year for us. All of our <a href="https://www.objc.io/books/">books</a> are now updated for Swift 4, and many of the new features inspired <a href="http://talk.objc.io/">Swift Talk</a> episodes, which are now grouped together in a handsomly illustrated set of <a href="https://talk.objc.io/collections">Collections</a>. We also quietly started writing a new book last summer — more about that soon.</p>

<h3>🏆 Most watched</h3>  
  
<p>It’s always interesting, and sometimes surprising, to see which episodes you watch the most. Here are the top five:</p>  
  
<p>🥇 <a href="https://talk.objc.io/episodes/S01E73-view-bindings-in-pure-swift">View Bindings in Pure Swift</a></p>  
  
<p>🥈 <a href="https://talk.objc.io/episodes/S01E59-refactoring-with-xcode-9">Refactoring with Xcode 9</a></p>  
  
<p>🥉 <a href="https://talk.objc.io/episodes/S01E60-xcode-9-productivity-tips">Xcode 9 Productivity Tips</a></p>  
  
<p>🙌 <a href="https://talk.objc.io/episodes/S01E01-tiny-networking-library">Tiny Networking Library</a> — a bit of a surprise for us, the very first episode we made!</p>  
  
<p>👏 <a href="https://talk.objc.io/episodes/S01E62-testable-view-controllers-with-reducers">Testable View Controllers with Reducers</a></p>  
  
<p>Thank you to everyone who watched, and a very special thanks to our subscribers, you make it all possible!</p>  
  
<h3>💡 Inspiration</h3>  
  
<p>We love experimenting with new techniques to make code simpler, and look for ideas both within and outside of the Swift community.</p>  
  
<p>We believe there’s a lot of inspiration to be drawn from languages like <a href="http://elm-lang.org/">Elm</a>, and we made a number of episodes about the Elm architecture in Swift, reducers, and <a href="https://talk.objc.io/episodes/S01E72-adding-a-custom-view-to-a-view-state-driven-app">view state</a>. Our experiments with <a href="https://talk.objc.io/collections/incremental-programming">Incremental Programming</a> were a direct cause of this: it’s a technique that helps you achieve a programming style similar to Elm while directly working with UIKit.</p>  
  
<p>Of course, the changes in Swift have been a big inspiration as well. For example, we weren’t too convinced by key paths at first, but they quickly proved themselves to be indispensable, allowing us to write things like <a href="https://talk.objc.io/episodes/S01E61-mutable-shared-structs-part-1">mutable shared structs</a>, view bindings in pure Swift, and a small but powerful <a href="https://talk.objc.io/episodes/S01E75-auto-layout-with-key-paths">Auto Layout wrapper</a>.</p>  
  
<h3>🔮 Looking ahead</h3>  
  
<p>We think 2018 is going to be a great year. In a few weeks, we’ll start the pre-release for our new book. Watch this space! We’re also looking forward to conditional conformance coming to Swift; it greatly simplifies the standard library, and opens up exciting new possibilities for type-safe programming.</p>  
  
<p>We’d like to thank everyone we’ve worked with, both directly and indirectly. Special thanks to Brandon, Degrau, Juul, Károly, Lisa, Morgan, Matt, Natalye, Ole, Paulo, Sarah, Rob, Wei, and Yuichiro. We couldn’t do it without you.</p>  
  
<p>Good luck with your projects! We can’t wait to get this year started.</p>  
  
<p>Best from Berlin,  
Florian and Chris</p>
