		<h2>WKWebView Workarounds</h2>
		<p><a href="http://inessential.com/2017/12/20/wkwebview_workarounds">Brent Simmons</a>:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p><code>WebView</code> — good ’ol trusty friend — has a bunch of things that <code>WKWebView</code> is missing.</p> 
<p>The new web view has no built-in support for finding text, for instance. I’m not sure what I’m going to do about this, since the ability to hit cmd-F and look for some text is a pretty fundamental thing, and I can’t skip it.</p> 
<p>It also has no delegate method for when you mouse over a link. Seems like another fundamental thing, right? Any browser offers you a status bar or some way to see the URL of the link your mouse is over.</p> 
</blockquote> 
 
<p>Given the level of progress over the last 3.5 or so years, it seems like <code>WKWebView</code> is the future, and too bad for you if you need more features. Maybe you can hack some of them together using JavaScript. With Apple no longer dogfooding <code>WebView</code>, how much longer will it be supported? This is the sort of thing that worries me about <a href="https://mjtsai.com/blog/2017/12/20/apple-rumored-to-combine-iphone-ipad-and-mac-apps-to-create-one-user-experience/">iOS APIs coming to the Mac</a>.</p>
