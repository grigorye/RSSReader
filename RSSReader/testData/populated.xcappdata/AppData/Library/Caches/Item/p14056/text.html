		<h2>Hyperion</h2>
		A drop-in in-app design debugging tool. Hyperion is a hidden plugin drawer that sits discreetly under your app and is designed to make inspection of your app quick and simple. It includes three default plugins for debugging your designs including the View Inspector to inspect the properties of any view, the Measurements plugin which lets you measure distances between two views, and the Slow Animations plugin to reduce animation speed in-app. You can also create and contribute your own third-party plugins by following the plugin creation guide. <br><br>View on <a href="https://iosdev.tools/tool?utm_source=feed&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=rss%20feed&amp;id=hyperion">iOS Dev Tools</a>.
