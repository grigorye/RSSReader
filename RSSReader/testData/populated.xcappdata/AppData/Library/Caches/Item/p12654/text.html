		<h2>Exploiting Vector Instructions with Generalized Stream Fusion</h2>
		<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/haskell-beats-C.pdf">Exploiting Vector Instructions with Generalized Stream Fusion</a> 
<p>By Geoffrey Mainland, Roman Leshchinskiy, and Simon Peyton Jones.</p> 
<div>A.k.a. <b>"Haskell beats C"</b>.</div> 
<blockquote> 
Our ideas are implemented 
in modified versions of the GHC compiler and vector 
library. Benchmarks show that high-level Haskell code written using 
our compiler and libraries can produce code that is faster than both 
compiler- and hand-vectorized C.</blockquote> 
 
<p>This paper continues the promising line of research started in <a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/3-540-19027-9_23.pdf">1990 by Wadler</a> (at least, that was how I learned of deforestation). Of course, there was a lot of development since then, but this specific paper introduces an interesting idea of multiple representations - potentially changing the game.</p>
