		<h2>App Idea: Mentions</h2>
		<p>“Hold on — I need to check my Mentions.”</p> 
 
<p>Ten years ago or more we had several blog-specific search engines and services: Technorati, BlogBridge, and others.</p> 
 
<p>One of the great things about these services was not just being able to search for something but being able to set up <em>persistent</em> searches: that is, you’d get a search as an RSS feed, and in your feed reader you’d get results from all over the place on the thing you’re searching for.</p> 
 
<p>In the obvious and common cases, you’d set up searches for people linking to your blog, writing about the apps you work on, mentioning the place where you work, and mentioning <em>you</em>.</p> 
 
<p>I’d like to see something like this for today, but where the scope is just the Apple/Mac/iOS community. It would crawl the obvious sites (such as Daring Fireball and Loop Insight) and it would crawl the many blogs and microblogs that make up the community.</p> 
 
<p>I <em>think</em> this is best as a web service, though it could have Mac and/or iOS client apps. It needs to provide feeds for people using feed readers.</p> 
 
<p style="text-align:center;">* * *</p> 
 
 
<p>With that reduced scope, and with the better tools and cheaper cloud computing these days, I don’t think it would be terribly expensive. Not like it was 15 years ago.</p> 
 
<p>You might want to make money with this, though, and there are a few ways to do it: charge extra for things like notifications and email alerts. Charge money for client apps. Make the first three search feeds free, and charge money for a ten-pack of searches. Etc.</p> 
 
<p style="text-align:center;">* * *</p> 
 
 
<p>An alternate version of this idea isn’t a web service — it’s a Mac and/or iOS app that does the crawling. A kind of specialized Mac/iOS feed reader.</p> 
 
<p>The list of feeds-to-crawl would probably just be an <a href="http://dev.opml.org">OPML</a> file on the web, and the app would periodically grab that list.</p> 
 
<p>(If you did this, you could use <a href="https://github.com/brentsimmons/RSParser">RSParser</a> as starter code, since it parses OPML, RSS, Atom, JSON Feed, and RSS-in-JSON.)</p> 
 
<p>This would make a great open source project, but it could just as well be free or for-pay.</p> 
 
<p style="text-align:center;">* * *</p> 
 
 
<p>One challenge is handling spam and abusive or hateful content. You’d most likely want to have a suggest-a-site form, so you don’t have to go out and find every single site there is.</p> 
 
<p>But you have to be able to say no, and you have to be able to update the list of sites-to-crawl quickly if a site turns bad or inappropriate somehow.</p> 
 
<p>You’d also need a way for users to report an issue.</p> 
 
<p>(Again, the reduced scope — Apple-related blogs — makes this somewhat easier than if you tried to do the entire blogosphere.)</p> 
 
<p style="text-align:center;">* * *</p> 
 
 
<p>I want this! I’d use it every day. I know other people who would too.</p> 
 
<p>But I’ve got enough on my plate that there’s no way I can do it myself — though I’d be happy to answer questions and provide feedback to anyone who does want to do it.</p>
