		<h2>Plant</h2>
		A simple and powerful version control app and plugin for Sketch. Plant works to organise your projects by keeping track of all versions and metadata including date, time, and the user that pushed the specific version, giving you access to the entire creative history of a project. It can even handle conflict resolution allowing you to choose, combine or create a new artboard, and diff-ing to compare any two versions of an artboard. Plantâ€™s panel lives inside Sketch's inspector letting you access current projects, add new projects, send your versions and will also notify you if there are changes that need to be loaded. <br><br>View on <a href="https://iosdev.tools/tool?utm_source=feed&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=rss%20feed&amp;id=plant">iOS Dev Tools</a>.
