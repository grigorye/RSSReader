		<h2>Twitter’s Weeds</h2>
		<p><a href="http://www.manton.org/2017/12/twitters-weeds.html">Manton Reece</a>:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>Because tweets don’t exist outside of Twitter, when you’re banned, you’re done. For this reason, and because their business depends on a large user base, Twitter is hesitant to throw anyone off their service. They’re unwilling to tend the garden for fear of pulling too many weeds.</p> 
<p>Imagine instead a service based on blogs, where the internal posts on the platform were the same format as the external posts. The curators of the platform would have more freedom to block harassing posts and ban nazis because those problematic users could always retreat to their own web site and leave everyone else in the community alone.</p> 
<p>That’s how the web is supposed to work. It’s a core principle of Micro.blog.</p> 
</blockquote> 
 
<p>I hope this can work, but as with App.net and Gab I find it hard to think about using a second service alongside Twitter.</p>
