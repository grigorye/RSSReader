		<h2>Mint</h2>
		A package manager that installs and runs Swift command line tools. Mint makes installing, running and distributing these tools much easier. It installs your tools via Swift Package Manager and globally installs and caches builds by version on demand. You can easily run the latest version or a specific version of a tool, or even use different versions of a tool side by side. Due to its use of Swift Package Manger for building tools, any tool that currently supports SPM automatically supports installing and running with Mint. <br><br>View on <a href="https://iosdev.tools/tool?utm_source=feed&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=rss%20feed&amp;id=mint">iOS Dev Tools</a>.
