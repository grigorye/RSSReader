		<h2>Microsoft is bringing clever tabs to every Windows 10 app</h2>
		One of the most popular feature requests (more than 20,000 votes) for Windows 10 is tabs in File Explorer. Microsoft has resisted adding tabs to File Explorer and apps in general for years, after originally introducing tabs in Internet Explorer 6 with a toolbar extension back in 2005. That resistance is about to change, in a big way. Microsoft is planning to add tabs to apps in Windows 10, allowing you to group together apps in a better way. 
 
Windows 10 testers will first start testing what Microsoft calls â€œSetsâ€� in the coming weeks, and the tab integration will be initially limited to Windows 10â€™s special Universal Windows Apps. Microsoft is planning to get as much feedback on the new feature as possible, before tweaking it and making it available to everyone. The software giant isnâ€™t committing to a specific timeline for tabs. 
 
This is an incredibly neat idea, and I can't wait to try and see if this feature makes any sense in my workflow.
