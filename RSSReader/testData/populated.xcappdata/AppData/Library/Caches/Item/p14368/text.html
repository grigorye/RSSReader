		<h2>Alan Kay’s Thoughts, Old and New</h2>
		<a href="https://www.mprove.de/diplom/gui/kay72.html">Alan Kay</a>, 1972 (via <a href="https://twitter.com/sdf_pubnix/status/946931232910163968">sdf</a>): 
<blockquote><p>A combination of this “carry anywhere” device and a global information utility such as the ARPA network or two-way cable TV, will bring the libraries and schools (not to mention stores and billboards) or the world to the home. One can imagine one of the first programs an owner will write is a filter to eliminate advertising!</p></blockquote>

<blockquote> 
<p>The <a href="http://worrydream.com/2017-12-30-alan/">excerpts from recent Alan Kay emails</a> are a gold mine. The text itself is a raw cut-up from a series of private emails. Kay argues that fundamental innovation and following objectives run counter to each other. Very much like art, fundamental research needs to be free from objective purpose.</p>
