		<h2>Former Apple Intern Looks Back at Designing First Apple Emoji in 2008</h2>
		<p><a href="https://medium.com/@agzmn/the-making-of-apples-emoji-how-designing-these-tiny-icons-changed-my-life-16317250a9ee">Angela Guzman</a> (via <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2018/01/11/2008-emoji-design-retrospective/">Juli Clover</a>, <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16126940">Hacker News</a>):</p> 
<blockquote><p>My first emoji was the engagement ring, and I chose it because it had challenging textures like metal and a faceted gem, tricky to render for a beginner. The metal ring alone took me an entire day. Pretty soon, however, I could do two a day, then three, and so forth. Regardless of how fast I could crank one out, I constantly checked the details: the direction of the woodgrain, how freckles appeared on apples and eggplants, how leaf veins ran on a hibiscus, how leather was stitched on a football, the details were neverending. I tried really hard to capture all this in every pixel, zooming in and zooming out, because every detail mattered. And for three months I stared at hundreds of emoji on my screen. Somewhere in there we also had our first Steve Jobs review, which had created a shared experience of suspense and success when they were approved for launch. And if Steve said it was good to go, Iâ€™d say lesson in craftsmanship, check.</p> 
<p>Sometimes our emoji turned out more comical than intended and some have a backstory. For example, Raymond reused his happy poop swirl as the top of the ice cream cone.</p></blockquote>
