		<h2>Visual Studio App Center</h2>
		A multi-platform CI solution from Microsoft. Visual Studio App Center lets you continuously build, test, release, and monitor apps for several platforms including native Swift/Objective-C iOS apps, React Native, Xamarin, macOS, and tvOS. It integrates with GitHub, Bitbucket, and VSTS and will automatically build and test your app on real hosted iOS and Android devices on every commit. You can also beta test your app with support for private distribution and TestFlight, and once your app is ready to release, you can submit it to the App Store or Google Play. <br><br>View on <a href="https://iosdev.tools/tool?utm_source=feed&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=rss%20feed&amp;id=appcenter">iOS Dev Tools</a>.
