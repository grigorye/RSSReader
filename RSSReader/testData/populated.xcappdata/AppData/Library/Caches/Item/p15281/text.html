		<h2>Running Old iOS Versions</h2>

<blockquote> 
<p>We were surprised to find out today that Apple is suddenly allowing users to downgrade their operating systems. If you have an older iPhone or an older iPad and were always a big fan of the older iOS and wished you had never upgraded your device, this may be your window of opportunity.</p> 
<p>[â€¦]</p> 
<p>It appears that this was a mistake at Apple. The window of opportunity only lasted a few hours. They have stopped signing older iOS versions now.</p>

<blockquote> 
<p>Itâ€™s a little frustrating that enabling the installation of older iOSes is a switch that Apple can [accidentally] flick at will, yet developers asked for firmware downgrades for years to set up test devices ðŸ¤· (I know, testing is an alien concept to current Appleâ€¦ ðŸ™ƒ)</p>

<blockquote> 
<p>Our Corellium Hypervisor for ARM enables us to run virtual iPhones in the cloud with game-changing features like:</p> 
<ul><li>Run any version of iOS</li> 
<li>On demand thread list &amp; kernel backtrace</li> 
<li>Optional jailbreak for any version</li> 
<li>Web-based debugging</li> 
<li>And much more!</li> 
</ul></blockquote> 
 
<p>Did they get a special license from Apple to do this?</p>
