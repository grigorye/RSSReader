		<h2>ScreenShield: SDK to Prevent Screenshots</h2>
		<p><a href="https://blog.getconfide.com/introducing-screenshield-ios-screenshot-prevention-for-confide-and-beyond-692bbae2c31d">Confide</a>:</p> 
<blockquote><p>ScreenShield is a patent-pending technology that allows you to view an app’s content on your screen but prevents you from taking a screenshot of it. If you try to take a screenshot on Confide, you will now simply capture a blank screen. ScreenShield also protects against other forms of screen capture, including iOS 11 screen recording, AirPlay screen mirroring, QuickTime screen recording as well as taking screenshots from the app switcher or by using Xcode.</p><p>We initially developed ScreenShield for Confide, but quickly realized that it could be used in a large number of apps — far more than we could build ourselves. That’s why we created <a href="https://screenshieldkit.com/">ScreenShieldKit</a> — to offer the ScreenShield technology to 3rd-party developers for use in a variety of different apps and categories.</p></blockquote>

<p>My best guess as to how they’re doing this is that they’re using AVPlayer and somehow using <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/iOSProgramming/comments/6h1nkc/how_are_apps_like_netflix_hbo_go_blocking_screen/">FairPlay Streaming</a> to block screenshots and recording. (Where by “my” best guess I mean the best guess of <a href="http://bitsplitting.org/">a smart friend</a> who poked around the Confide app bundle.) Have you ever noticed how you can’t take screenshots of streaming video content in apps like Netflix and HBO Go/Now? That’s a feature in iOS (and MacOS — try taking a screenshot of Netflix video playing in Safari) for skittish video providers who don’t want us to capture even a still frame of their precious content. I <em>think</em> ScreenShieldKit is somehow using this to prevent screenshots or video captures of text or images.</p>

<p>If I’m reading their application correctly, Confide also has also filed for a patent <a href="http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-bool.html&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;co1=AND&amp;d=PTXT&amp;s1=9648001&amp;OS=9648001&amp;RS=9648001">for a way to identify when you’re using another device to take a photo of your screen</a>.</p>

<p>Please do not use FairPlay to block screen capture of non-premium video content. It’s not for your ‘secure’ messaging app.</p>
