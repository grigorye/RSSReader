		<h2>Flawless</h2>
		A real-time comparison tool that lets you compare your expected and implemented designs. Flawless is built into iOS simulator so is easy to make part of your development workflow. You start by dragging in your designs in any of a number of different formats (including Sketch), which will then appear on your iOS simulator. You can then toggle between overlay or split comparison modes for spotting any visual differences between the expected design and your implementation. <br><br>View on <a href="https://iosdev.tools/tool?utm_source=feed&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=rss%20feed&amp;id=flawless">iOS Dev Tools</a>.
