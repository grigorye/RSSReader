		<h2>Monodraw v1.3: CLI Enabled</h2>
		<p> 
We have been working on an update that brings a command line tool to Monodraw! 
</p>

<p> 
Monodraw v1.3 includes a new command line tool. You can use it generate text from your monopic files in a terminal. 
For example, this can be useful if you want to automate the export process. 
</p> 
 
<h2>Installation</h2> 
 
<p> 
Once you have installed v1.3, head to the main menu and you will find a new entry named “Command Line Tool…”.

This would open a new window which will show you the current path of the tool and provide you the ability to create a symlink, 
so that the “monodraw” command will work in your terminal.

<p> 
Unfortunately, due to <a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-sandboxing/">App Sandboxing</a> restrictions on the Mac App Store, 
only the Direct version of Monodraw includes the command line tool.
