		<h2>Unsurprising</h2>
		<p>Remember when people said that <a href="http://ignorethecode.net/blog/2013/09/13/the_videogame_sales_cycle/">consoles were dead, and that Nintendo’s only chance for survival (and probably Apple’s only chance to get really good high-budget games on iOS) would be for Nintendo to make iPhone games</a>?</p> 
 
<p>Well, Nintendo’s new console is <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/games/1752629/the-nintendo-switch-just-passed-a-major-sales-record">doing really well</a>,[^ps4] their good iOS game <a href="http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2017-03-24-nintendo-disappointed-by-super-mario-run-revenues">«disappointed» Nintendo</a>, while their <a href="http://uk.businessinsider.com/nintendo-fire-emblem-heroes-microtransactions-2017-2?r=US&amp;IR=T">shitty</a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/man-spends-1-000-in-fire-emblem-heroes-still-doesnt-h-1792134459">manipulative</a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/loot-boxes-are-designed-to-exploit-us-1819457592">gambling-based</a> mobile games seem to be doing well enough. And now, <a href="http://reverttosaved.com/2017/12/12/simogo-quits-iphone-and-ipad-gaming-and-points-the-finger-of-blame-at-apple/">great iOS devs are leaving the platform</a>.</p> 
 
<p>Telling Nintendo to abandon its hardware platform for iOS was never a good idea. It doesn’t help Nintendo, and it doesn’t help iOS. There is no sustainable market on iOS for really good, non-abusive, fairly priced mid- to high-budget games, and Nintendo can’t fix that. The only company that can fix that is Apple.</p> 
 
<p>I don’t think anyone should be surprised by any of this.</p> 
 
<p>[^ps4]: Importantly, so is the PS4. The Xbox One is doing okay, but considering that Microsoft nowadays seems to view the Xbox as merely a platform for playing Windows games without the hassle of actually running Windows, that’s probably not particularly surprising, either.</p>
