		<h2>Apple Support Tells Customers to Ask Developer for Refund</h2>
		<p><a href="https://twitter.com/DazeEnd/status/946137036855136263">Charles Perry</a>:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>I would like to offer a giant raised middle finger to @AppStore Support for continuing to tell customers that they should contact me directly for a refund. @AppStore knows developers have no way to refund a purchase. Stop telling customers that we can!</p> 
</blockquote> 
<p>This has been happening for all 9.5 years of the App Store. And some of the customers think we’re lying in order to keep their money when we say they have to ask Apple—because they reasonably assume that Apple knows how its own store works. Unfortunately, refunds are quite literally something <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2014/06/only_apple">only Apple can do</a>.</p>

<blockquote> 
<p>This has happened for years, but since they recently removed the “Not working as expected” option on http://reportaproblem.apple.com, it’s started happening far more often. We’ve sent some angry customers refunds directly at a 30% loss, but it’s unsustainable.</p>

<blockquote> 
<p>I subscribed to a year of a digital mag through the @AppStore and they stopped publishing 4 months in @AppleSupport said the app should refund me and I only have 30 days to ask #apple for a refund. Great scam charge for 12 months and Apple won’t help after 1st month</p>
