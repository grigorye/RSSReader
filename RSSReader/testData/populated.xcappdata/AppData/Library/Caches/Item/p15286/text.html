		<h2>The Kindle Moment: Fire and Fury</h2>
		<p><a href="https://www.kirkville.com/the-kindle-moment/">Kirk McElhearn</a>:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>You’ll note that the Kindle version currently costs more than the (unavailable) hardcover. This is a sort of surge pricing for books; why discount the hottest book of the season? It’s not a loss leader like the latest novels by Dan Brown or Stephen King, it’s a must-read that people want now, because it won’t be as interesting in a week, after many of the salacious elements are reported in the press.</p> 
<p>It’s not often that a book like this drives demand so much that the publisher can’t keep up. Amazon is stepping in to help meet that demand, shifting a lot of readers from print to ebook. Even if they don’t have Kindles, they can read it on their phones or tablets.</p>

<p>I bet there are a lot of shared highlights.</p>
