		<h2>The “app” You Can’t Trash: How SIP Is Broken in High Sierra</h2>
		<p><a href="https://eclecticlight.co/2018/01/02/the-app-you-cant-trash-how-sip-is-broken-in-high-sierra/">Howard Oakley</a>:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>So how did this third-party kernel extension end up in this mysterious folder, complete with SIP protection? Surely SIP is there to protect macOS, not third-party app components installed later by the user? Who or what enabled SIP on that extension, and how can it be removed?</p> 
<p>[…]</p> 
<p>High Sierra has a new mechanism for handling third-party kernel extensions (User-Approved Kernel Extension Loading, or UAKL), which requires the user to authorise them. When a third-party installer tries to install a kernel extension, you see the warning[…] High Sierra then packages the extension in the form of a non-executable stub app, which it installs in /Library/StagedExtensions/Applications.</p> 
<p>[…]</p> 
<p>Thus SIP prevents the user from uninstalling a third-party app which the user installed, even though the kernel extension might be rendering macOS unstable, or have other significant side-effects.</p>
