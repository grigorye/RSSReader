		<h2>Make Your Apps Available for Pre-Order</h2>
		<p>You can now make your new apps available for pre-order on the App Store on all Apple platforms. Customers can see your product page and order your app before it’s released for download. Once your app is released, customers will be notified and it will automatically download to their device. Let your customers know your app is coming by using the pre-order badges in your marketing materials.</p><p><span><a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/pre-orders/">Learn more about offering your apps for pre-order</a></span>.</p>
