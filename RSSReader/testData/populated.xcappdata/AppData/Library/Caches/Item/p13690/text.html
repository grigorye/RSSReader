		<h2>iOS 11 Double Copying</h2>
		<p><a href="http://leancrew.com/all-this/2017/12/undoubling/">Dr. Drang</a>:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>There are some weird things going on with iOS’s Copy item in the Share Sheet. I made a short Workflow to get around a problem I’ve been having with it when trying to share the URL of a Washington Post story.</p> 
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/drdrang/status/931899542055866368">I mentioned the problem on Twitter</a> a few weeks ago: I’m reading an article in the WaPo app that I want to link to. I bring up the Share Sheet, tap Copy, and switch to some other app I want to paste the URL into. Could be <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/drafts-quick-capture/id905337691?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=10I4Fv">Drafts</a>, Notes, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/slack/id618783545?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=10I4Fv">Slack</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/textastic-code-editor-6/id1049254261?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=10I4Fv">Textastic</a>—whatever. I then paste the URL and wait to see what happens. Depending on the app, I might get exactly what I expect (Notes and Textastic), or I might get a doubled version of the URL (Drafts and Slack).</p> 
</blockquote> 
<p>I’ve seen this, too, copying from other apps. I wonder what’s causing this.</p>
