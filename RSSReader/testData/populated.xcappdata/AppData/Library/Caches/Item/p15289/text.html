		<h2>Apple Comments on AirPort’s Future</h2>
		<p><a href="http://www.idownloadblog.com/2018/01/11/apple-comment-airport-future/">Christian Zibreg</a> (via <a href="https://twitter.com/mattbirchler/status/951491249940389889">Matt Birchler</a>):</p> 
<blockquote><p>As <a href="http://www.idownloadblog.com/2018/01/11/apple-linksys-velop-mesh-wi-fi/">Apple started selling</a>  the first third-party Wi-Fi router in the form of Linksys’ Velop, its spokesperson provided a comment regarding the future of its own AirPort line of appliances.</p><p>In a statement to 9to5Mac, which first spotted the presence of Velop devices on Apple’s online and retail stores, Apple <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2018/01/10/apple-mesh-wifi-system-airport/">acknowledged</a> that it’s still selling AirPort Wi-Fi base stations: […] Unfortunately, the cryptic comment doesn’t say whether Apple plans on keeping AirPort alive.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote> 
<p>We believe that we need to own and control the primary technologies behind the products we make, and participate only in markets where we can make a significant contribution.</p> 
<p>We believe in saying no to thousands of projects so that we can really focus on the few that are truly important and meaningful to us.</p>

<p>Update (2018-01-12): <a href="https://pxlnv.com/linklog/linksys-future-of-airport/">Nick Heer</a>:</p> 
<blockquote> 
<p>A reader email reminded me that Apple took <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/article/here-is-every-patch-for-krack-wi-fi-attack-available-right-now/">at least</a> <a href="https://www.macobserver.com/news/product-news/apple-patches-krack-airport-firmware-updates/">two months to patch</a> their base station products to protect against a <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/10/what-you-should-know-about-the-krack-wifi-security-weakness/">significant WiFi vulnerability</a>. iOS and MacOS were updated <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2017/10/apple-releases-macos-10-13-1-and-ios-11-1-with-a-krack-fix-and-new-emoji/">within two <em>weeks</em></a>. I don’t know if the thirdhand information I have is right, of course, but the general thrust of the reports I’ve seen and moves Apple has made when it comes to their AirPort lineup strongly suggests that they’re not interested in the WiFi router market much longer.</p>
