<p>There were 12 wonderful presentations, 1 workshop and 1 open space to set the stage for JUC China. 
The day began with Kohsuke, welcomed to the stage by all the attendees here with their warm 
applauses. All of them are fans of Jenkins and Kohsuke.  Thanks to Kohsuke, he made a wonderful presentation to show the past, present and future of Jenkins for Chinese Jenkins users.</p>
