// MARK: - Improved logging primitives

/// A type with a customized log representation.
///
/// Types that conform to the `CustomLogConvertible` protocol can provide
/// their own representation to be used when logging using a `LogSubsystem`.
///
/// Accessing a type's `logStatement` property directly is discouraged.
///
/// Conforming to the CustomLogConvertible Protocol
/// ===============================================
///
/// Add `CustomLogConvertible` conformance to your custom types by defining
/// a `logStatement` property.
///
/// For example, this custom `Point` struct uses the default representation
/// supplied by the standard library:
///
///     struct Point {
///         let x: Int, y: Int
///     }
///
///     let p = Point(x: 21, y: 30)
///     Log.show("Point of order: \(p)")
///     // Logs "Point of order: <redacted>" to Console
///
/// After implementing `CustomLogConvertible` conformance, the `Point`
/// type provides a custom representation:
///
///     extension Point: CustomLogConvertible {
///         var logStatement: LogStatement {
///             return "(\(x), \(y))"
///         }
///     }
///
///     Log.show("Point of order: \(p)")
///     // Logs "Point of order: (21, 30)" to Console
///
/// - see: `CustomStringConvertible`
public protocol CustomLogConvertible {
    /// A programmer's representation of `self`. The returned value is printed
    /// to the console log.
    var logStatement: LogStatement { get }
}

/// The logging namespace. All methods record to the Apple Unified Logging
/// System.
///
/// Use it when the additional context of a subsystem wouldn't be useful, or
/// when replacing legacy logging mechanisms.
///
///     Log.show("Hello, world!")
///     Log.debug("Logged in with \(id)")
///     Log.assert(!frame.isEmpty, "You messed it up!")
///
/// - important: Log message lines greater than the system’s maximum message
///   length are truncated. Complete messages are visible when using the `log`
///   tool to view a live stream of activity.
