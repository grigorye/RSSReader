# RSSReader

Yet another RSS Reader. My pet project for testing some ideas related to programming, Swift, iOS app development and etc.

## Appearance

Don't do much but rely on UIAppearance. Custom (dummy) classes are used as tags.

## Formatting

Nothing special, most of the stuff is hardcoded. Anyway, all formatters are shared/configured in one place.
