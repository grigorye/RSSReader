/// When it replaces `$` used without passing-through the logged value, disables logging and supresses evaluation of `argument`.

/// Consider Baz.swift that uses `$` for logging value of `cos(foo)` and `foo`:
/// ````
/// func sinPi() -> Float {
///     let foo = Float.pi
///     $(cos(foo))
///     let bar = sin($(foo))
///     return bar
/// }
/// ````
/// To temporarily supress logging *and* evaluation of `cos(foo)`
/// ````
/// $(cos(foo))
/// ````
/// should be changed to
/// ````
/// •(cos(foo))
/// ````
/// , hence replacing `$` with `•`, leaving the possibility to enable logging again just by replacing `•` with `$`.
///
/// Not adding `•` above would result in a compiler warning about unused value as well as wasting cpu on no-effect invocation.
